Test-Programs
=============

All of the programs made for testing purposes and not for the season go here.

Non-Team Member Usage
---------------------

Please do not use our works to your own benefit! You may browse the code and learn from it, maybe copy a line or two, but you may not download or use in other ways any files. Use our code as a resource, not a shortcut. Even if you did copy enough of our code, our robot and tactics are diffrent and it may not be compatible.

Team Member Usage
-----------------

For documentation on how to optimally use GitHub for the team, see the wiki in this season's repository.
